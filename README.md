### Introduction
This repository is for our Pacific Graphics 2018 paper '[Non-Local Low-Rank Normal Filtering for Mesh Denoising](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cgf.13556)'. In this paper, we present a non-local low-rank normal filtering method for mesh denoising. By exploring the geometric similarity between local surface patches on 3D meshes in the form of normal fields, we devise a low-rank recovery model that filters normal vectors by means of patch groups.

In this repository, we release demo (exe files), code (C++), and data.

### Usage
To try our method for mesh denoising, you can directly run the 'NLLR.exe' inside `demo.rar`.
```
upzip the demo.rar
copy noisy mesh into the demo folder (e.g., child_n3.off)
run: NLLR.exe child_n3.off 0.39 10 10
```
'child_n3.off' is the input noisy mesh, 0.39 is the sigma_M in our paper, 10 is the N_k and 10 is the number of vertex updating. You will see the denoised mesh inside the same folder. For the 'NLLR.exe', you can refer to `NLLR` folder for the source code.

To evaluate the denoising performance, you can directly run the 'evaluation.exe' inside `demo.rar`.
```
upzip the demo.rar
copy ground truth mesh into the demo folder (e.g., child.off)
run: evaluation.exe child.off denoised_result.off
```
'child.off' is the ground truth mesh, 'denoised_result.off' is the denoised mesh. You will see the mean square angle error (MSAE).
